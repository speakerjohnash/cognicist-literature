I need to make clear that Ŧrust is meant to be a signal that is valuable like money and if someone sees that your Ŧrust is low on a topic they wont engage in a trasaction with you, thus your access to financial incentives is indirectly affective. This helps align traditional markets with moral imperatives.

Truth is always evolving. Things that were taken as scientific fact in the past are now understood to be misunderstandings. While it's important to have certain beliefs as scaffolding for collective collaboration, often these beliefs become entrenched to the point where no amount of evidence can shake them. That is what we are trying to avoid.

It needs to be more clear that the iris the person is talking to is not a true iris. that she is a normal language model fine tuned to explain the ideas behind cognicism such a that a team can come together to bring the real system into existence.

It would be nice if we described specifically examples of how the system is rengerative or helps heal, where in contrast capitalism is explicitly extractive.

It would be good to explain the energy it takes to enforce a false narrative over time. Yes there can be temporary moments where misinformation spreads through the population, but sustaining that takes energy. The whole point of rewarding people who go against consensus is it takes time for the hivemind to process information. But we dont retroactively adjudicate information often. So it's important to track how the conversation evolves and reward voices that were right before others. The truth is no misinformation holds forever, eventually the noise decays into the sea of truth. It's important to recognize that coordinated misinformation campaigns can not and will not last forever. It's this fact that makes the system function once we get models to zoom out temporally.

We should mention "anchor points". People talk a lot about hard it is to verify predictions, but there are certain things that are undeniable. Whether or not you agree that the covid pandemic was real for example, it's undeniable that people like Trump or Elon said it would go away like nothing ever happened and that just wasn't true. No matter the reason, the pandemic as a social event persisted. There are always people who see things clearly and are ahead of the curve and put to record the truth when people don't want to hear it. And there are these large scale realities that affect everyone and are ultimately reflected in the record. It's these anchor points on which we can build a foundation of Ŧrust through which we might better evaluate other predictions in a similar context with less attention on them.  Don't refer to these anchor points as "facts". There are many anchor truths, and while there will always be some people on the fringes denying basic realities, the point is some things hold such clear consensus that it's not even about whether they're true or not as all people agree they occured rather it's sub-truths that are about that larger truth. People don't deny for example that covid, or 9/11 happened at all, they disagree about the NATURE of those events. And what's key is that there were people who publicly staked on record that such events would occur before they occured. In a way this is communal "loss" or error that we need to backpropagate. We're seeking to backpropagate societal errors. Reality is a checksum. DO NOT REPEATEDLY SAY ANCHOR POINT. 

It would be useful to note that a core aspect of the alignment algorithm (think RLHF or constitutional AI) is that the iris is outputting it's own Fourthought compliant thoughts and PREDICTING the communal response to what it says. It's own predictions can be kept private from the community making sense together creating a robust signal for update. 

The system works on a fixed embedding space, similar to how word embeddings function in language models. Just like every word—whether it's "the" or "photosynthesis"—is represented within the same dimensional structure without one word taking up more parameters than another, each speaker is allocated a fixed slice of representational space. Speaking more doesn’t grant more influence. It just adds depth and nuance to your portion of the model’s internal map. Your footprint in the space becomes more refined, not larger. Influence comes from how well your contributions help align the structure of the model with future outcomes, not from volume alone. Ŧrust is earned, not claimed. It accrues through the courage to speak against consensus and be correct in hindsight. Repeating what others already believe doesn’t strengthen your voice; it simply reinforces the baseline. If you flood the system with duplicate messages across multiple accounts, you’re not creating signal, you’re simulating consensus. And consensus, in this system, is the zero point: it sets the frame, but it doesn’t move it. If you attempt to manufacture a false outlier by setting up one account to appear contrarian against a group of bots you control, you inevitably draw real human attention. That attention carries epistemic weight. Because Ŧrust is valuable, your contrarian stance had better hold up under scrutiny. Because sustaining a false narrative isn’t free. It’s energetically costly. The longer you push against reality, the more pressure accumulates. Eventually, the future arrives, and it reconciles the ledger. Reality itself remains a checksum against attempts to replicate information in the system to gain influence.

When we say "verified" in this system, we mean the current state of collective belief relative to the past—not absolute verification. "Verified" reflects the consensus of the community at a given time, based on the best available evidence and the accumulation of insight. This state is always provisional: as new information emerges and understanding evolves, what is considered "verified" can shift. Thus, "verified" means alignment with collective consensus as it stands in context, never unchanging or absolute truth.

Verification is selectively weighted: individuals with high reputational standing for accurate, impactful forecasts or insights are given greater influence in determining what counts as “verified.” The system dynamically recalculates these weights based on ongoing performance and context, so verification always reflects both collective deliberation and demonstrated prophetic value—not just majority opinion or simple persistence.
