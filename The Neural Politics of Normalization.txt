The Neural Politics of Normalization: How Extreme Ideas Become Mainstream

Listen, I get it — you think Trumpism operates on a basic formula: say something extreme to get Democrats into an uproar over something Republicans “aren’t actually going to do” (like annexing Canada or selecting Matt Gaetz as AG), while quietly advancing less extreme but still significant policies they want to implement under the cover of that distraction.

But here’s the crucial thing that’s often overlooked: this tactic doesn’t just serve as a temporary distraction. Through repeated exposure, it actually rewires people’s neural pathways in ways that have lasting consequences. Research in cognitive psychology shows that when people are repeatedly exposed to extreme ideas — even in the context of rejecting them — those ideas become more cognitively accessible and potentially more acceptable over time.

This happens because our brains form dense networks of associated thoughts, emotions, and memories. When someone says “election integrity,” it doesn’t trigger just one thought — it activates an entire constellation of connected ideas about democracy, fear, trust, identity, and power. Each time these neural networks fire together, the connections strengthen. What starts as a shocking new concept gradually becomes wired into our existing mental architecture. As Hebbs’ Law suggests: “What fires together wires together”.

The result is a dual effect: not only does the initial shock value serve its immediate tactical purpose of distraction, but the repeated exposure gradually shifts what people consider acceptable or even desirable. Ideas that were once considered beyond the pale slowly enter mainstream discourse, and eventually, policy proposals. This creates a feedback loop where today’s “outrageous suggestion” can become tomorrow’s policy position, not because of a deliberate bait-and-switch, but because the very act of putting these ideas into public discourse begins to normalize them.

What makes this particularly powerful is how it exploits fundamental principles of brain function. Our brains are constantly trying to conserve energy. It’s literally metabolically expensive to maintain strong emotional reactions to ideas we encounter frequently. So over time, through pure efficiency, our brains start treating these previously shocking concepts as routine. The neural pathways that initially triggered strong rejection become worn smooth through repeated activation. It’s not that we necessarily agree — it’s that our brains literally can’t sustain the energy cost of constant outrage.

This normalization process is particularly powerful because it exploits our brain’s fundamental aversion to uncertainty. Novel or moderate ideas often require complex, nuanced thinking that introduces cognitive uncertainty. In contrast, extreme positions, once familiar, offer the comfort of simplicity and certainty. Our brains, when faced with choosing between a familiar extreme position and a novel moderate one, will often default to the familiar pattern — even if it’s objectively more radical. This preference for familiar patterns over uncertain novelty means that once extreme ideas become cognitively comfortable, they actually feel less threatening to our brains than new moderate alternatives. It’s quite literally more metabolically expensive for our brains to maintain the state of uncertainty required for nuanced thinking than to fall back on familiar, even if extreme, thought patterns.

The events of January 6th provide a stark example of this normalization process in action. In 2016, contesting an election through direct action at the Capitol would have been considered unthinkable by virtually all Republicans. Yet despite over 60 court cases being dismissed — many by Trump-appointed judges — and no evidence of widespread fraud being presented, the repeated assertion of election fraud normalized the rejection of democratic processes. What started as fringe conspiracy theories became mainstream positions, culminating in violence that many justified. Now, we see the same dismissive attitudes toward warnings about “deportation centers” evolving into concentration camps — as if the previous normalization of election denial hasn’t shown exactly how quickly extreme positions can become accepted reality.

What makes this process particularly effective is how it operates on multiple levels simultaneously. While mainstream attention focuses on the most provocative statements, the most extreme supporters take these statements not as rhetorical devices but as genuine dog whistles — signals of intent. These individuals then work quietly but persistently to spread these ideas within their communities, gradually pushing the boundaries of acceptable discourse and behavior. By the time the broader public realizes how far the goalposts have shifted, the transformation in political norms has already taken root.

This process has been supercharged by digital technology, which enables what we might call the “outsourcing of cognitive labor.” When individuals encounter information that challenges their beliefs, they don’t have to do the energetically expensive work of reconciling these contradictions themselves. Instead, they can instantly tap into vast networks of like-minded individuals who provide ready-made explanations and rationalizations. These online communities function as self-reinforcing “memetic bubbles,” where extreme ideas don’t just survive — they evolve and strengthen through constant reinforcement.

The algorithmic architecture of social media platforms dramatically accelerates this process. These systems are designed to maximize engagement, which means they naturally amplify content that triggers strong emotional reactions. When someone engages with increasingly extreme content — even to argue against it — the algorithms interpret this as interest and serve more similar content. This creates automated feedback loops that speed up the neural rewiring process. What might have taken years of normal exposure can now happen in months or even weeks through algorithmic amplification. The recommendation systems essentially function as accelerants for neural pathway formation, constantly reinforcing and strengthening particular thought patterns while drowning out alternative perspectives.

We’re witnessing this same pattern unfold again with mass deportation proposals, though most Americans remain unaware of how their own thoughts about it are slowly shifting. What began as rhetoric that many dismissed as hyperbole or electoral posturing is steadily advancing toward concrete policy planning, but few can consciously track how their own reactions have evolved over time. Despite popular belief about “presence” most people live entirely in the present moment — they can’t remember their visceral shock and rejection from two years ago, let alone eight. They don’t notice how today’s “practical discussions” about implementation would have been unthinkable to their past selves. The progression is familiar, yet invisible to those experiencing it: first, the idea enters public discourse as an “outrageous” suggestion that critics say would be logistically impossible and constitutionally questionable. Then, through repeated discussion and normalization, it shifts from “impossible” to “challenging but necessary” in certain circles — not through conscious acceptance, but through the gradual rewiring of neural pathways that most people never notice happening. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, policy architects begin developing detailed implementation plans, transforming what was once considered an extreme talking point into a blueprint for action. The infrastructure — both physical and bureaucratic — begins to be assembled piece by piece, while public resistance gradually weakens through sheer exhaustion and familiarity with the concept. This weakening isn’t a conscious choice — most people don’t wake up one day deciding to accept what they once rejected. Instead, their brains quietly adapt to repeated exposure, making the unthinkable thinkable without them ever realizing how their own thoughts have been restructured.

This is why understanding the neural mechanics of normalization is so crucial. These aren’t just political tactics — they’re exploiting fundamental features of how our brains process and adapt to new information. The physical structure of our brains makes us vulnerable to this kind of manipulation. Each exposure to extreme ideas, even in the context of rejection, creates new neural pathways that make these concepts more accessible and acceptable over time. Combined with the energy-saving tendency of our brains and the amplifying effects of digital media, this process can rapidly transform previously unthinkable ideas into accepted political positions.

The challenge now is to recognize and actively counter these mechanisms before they fundamentally reshape our conception of what’s possible and permissible in American democracy. Because once these neural pathways are established — once extreme ideas become normalized through repeated exposure and reinforcement — they don’t simply disappear. They become part of our cognitive infrastructure, influencing how we process and evaluate all future political possibilities.

Understanding these neural mechanisms points to specific strategies for resistance. First, we can practice active temporal perspective-taking — regularly reminding ourselves of our past reactions to ideas that now feel normal. Second, we can deliberately build and maintain competing neural pathways by regularly exposing ourselves to historical examples of how similar normalization processes have played out. Third, we can create social and cognitive ‘circuit breakers’ — predetermined points at which we step back and consciously re-evaluate whether shifting positions reflect reasoned changes or simply neural adaptation to repeated exposure. Most importantly, we can work to build resilient communities of perspective-holding, where groups actively help each other maintain awareness of how their reactions and tolerances may be shifting over time.

The time to understand and resist this process is now, before these changes to our collective neural architecture become permanent and irreversible.
