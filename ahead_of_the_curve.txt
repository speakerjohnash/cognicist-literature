That there is knowledge that will be valuable to future peoples, and we should incentivize and retroactively reward staking that knowledge in the face of collective dissonance

It took the relentless work of Clair Patterson, a geochemist who gathered global samples and exposed widespread environmental lead contamination, to finally shift public policy. Despite having the data, Patterson was silenced, discredited, and excluded from institutional platforms because his insights disrupted profit structures. 

Ignaz Semmelweis, who identified hand washing as a means to prevent maternal deaths, was mocked and driven to mental collapse, leading to his institutionalization amid relentless professional opposition. 

Rachel Carson faced coordinated attacks from the chemical industry after publishing Silent Spring, warning of DDT’s ecological harms. 

Alice Stewart discovered a link between X-rays during pregnancy and childhood cancer. Her findings were dismissed for years because they challenged prevailing medical practices and standards. 

Mona Hanna-Attisha exposed lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan’s water supply. Initially discredited by officials despite clear data, she was later vindicated.

These people are "prophets" because they see the value of information to the collective before the collective is ready or willing to see it. And then they work tirelessly to disseminate this information without reward.

DON'T JUST MENTION THEIR NAMES. PRESENT THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS IN CONTEXT.
