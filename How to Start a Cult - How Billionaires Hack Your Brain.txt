(00:00) memetics what is mimetics how does a new meme get into a mind a fundamentally New Meme a meme is like a named pattern a meme has a mapping between the name of it some sort of neural representation which is activated when it is observed in the world and something in the real world which is being mapped or modeled so a meme is a subunit of information that can take root in the mind of a being your neocortex is like a great field it is where thought trees are planted in it's where uh structures of ideation grow and
(00:49) interconnect with each other usually this happens through something called uh heb's law which is basically that what fires together wise together if you have a thought that is containing different semantic parts and they're activated at the same time it's more likely in the future that those cortical structures will be further connected in the future okay so how do you get a new meme into the mind in the left brain you have The Language Center The Language Center has a large vocabulary that maps to cortical
(01:18) structures so you can learn a new meme by constructing from other memes and then naming that large body of information and then just integrating it into the brain what we have is basically an essay a thesis you read the thesis you label it with the term and this is actually a very difficult way to acquire knowledge because you're requiring the vocabulary of another person if you don't have the same vocabulary and the same meaning behind the words is going to be hard to reconstruct that meaning so instead the other way to get new memes in the
(01:57) mind is to ideate them yourself is to synthesize them yourself now I could write a Manifesto about cognizism I could go on for days and days and days of explaining it it will not Vibe as much as if somebody simply thinks about prediction markets uh language large language models and cryptography at the same time and then gets an idea whatever sense of inspiration that they have in the moment that is a connecting of those cortical structures that it creates a pathway through which they can flow down and it will guide and structure their
(02:29) behavior this is the whole neural manifold stuff that Matt brokowski talks about now I think about it in terms of cortical structures and he thinks about it in terms of the actual activations and the mathematical patterns and the topology of the connection of all the neurons within that space and I reduce it to a much less smaller and simpler level of a resolution of complexity to be able to unders explain it to myself he's a lot more precise okay so why am I talking about this I'm talking about this because there is a particular type
(02:58) of magic magic with a k Magic with K being a particular type of manipulative mimetics that uh big boy Trump did on the people that Elon Musk met him in 2016 when he was called to the office after the election he studied him and he was the only person to learn what Trump did then Elon applied those much those he flies and stick sneaks over the six years to achieve the exact same effect and it's like nobody gets it nobody understands how he did it but I get it and I'm like it's the equations that are about partitioning internal from external
(03:39) States [Music] it's the equations that are about partitioning internal from external States it's the equations that are about partitioning internal from external States what does the cover of the active inference textbook mean like instead of the inscription there's math [Laughter] um yes there's the Lord of the Rings reference and also it's a a blanket and it's a particle and it that's the equations that are about partitioning internal from external States Bagel please my friends lovers yeah countrymen I'm trying to tell you
(04:40) what he's doing memes exist in relation to other means this is Jordan Hall this is Forest this is relationality this is where they're talking about and so obsessed about relationality I'm like you know it has relationality patterns of [ __ ] neurons clusters of neurons and you go to Matt prakashi he's like you know these fractal self affine representations it's like yeah you have structures of neurons where like the sub patterns seem to repeat themselves in interesting ways they manifest behavior when information
(05:14) flows through those systems so your thought basically comes through you flowing through these systems and most of your thoughts are related to that what if you wanted to get a thought into another prison's brain against their will how could you get that mean in there and then what would happen once it's already in there this is the great magic of what Trump did the great magic of what Elon did so Elon has a goal in his brain there's a topological structure that says get to Mars I'm gonna be the one who puts people on Mars I'm the Mars man I'm
(05:48) Gonna Save Humanity it's not actually bait based on first principles thinking it's not really like the best solution to save Humanity it's the fact that he read science fiction as a kid and somehow it took root in his mind and then he became the person who wanted to do that and everything links back to that and then in 2018 what happened was he was threatened to be kicked out of his companies they were going to take his power he almost lost all of his power he almost lost all of his power in 2018 please listen
(06:23) to this again he almost lost all of his power in 2018 because Tesla was not a profitable company okay so what happened is profit became a new first principle in his mind he realized finally that he can't just pursue social good which is what he wanted to do he wanted to save the world he was always thinking about the world in terms of social good and so he adopted a new first principle what was the new first principle you always have to make profit first prophet Market meme that before all else became his God because that which is your first
(07:15) principles that which is at the root of yourself that which is at the core Center of your being guides the flow of your thought so in 2018 what did Elon do he realized he was losing his power he realized he had to get his power back and he had to get a lot of it and he observed Donald Trump and he had Zerg Donald Trump rapidly accrued power he also made the correct realization that people like money and that his companies were extremely profitable nobody would really be able to stop him and he would be able to do
(07:53) whatever he wants which at the time sounded great to him because at the time his neural structure was different so the types of thoughts that he was having so he sat in 2018 with all of these good intentions about how he would change the world and make it better and then fact that is still where he thinks he's operating from and that's why you guys still think that he's a good person and doing good things because technically technically there is part of the first principle that still links back to it but the problem is is that he deeply
(08:26) linked this notion of profit and that comes with it a whole meme set which guides and flows natural behavior it relates to power being an accrual thing that if you just collect enough of it then you can control all other people and if you control other people if you wear the ring of power then you have influence over all the things that happen if only we could have the one true ring and influence everybody with our own personal vision Circle [ __ ] bagel the circle is a meme the circle represents kind of what Elon is doing
(09:11) with his own name and what Trump is doing with his own brain but the circle is an anti-memetic it's like a uh intentional manipulation by other in your in your mind because it's it's teaching you about the ideas behind the way the brain structures itself using thermodynamic flows and how your behavior will often be shaped by these underlying structures and it's really hard to push back against these underlying structures and if you know a theory of memetics and you understand mimetics well you can actually push the
(09:45) meme into people and then it can kind of predictively affect their behavior but also unpredictably so you think you know what's going to happen in that person's brain but and then all this other crazy stuff happens because you don't really understand mathematics you understand the very basic nature of it what does Trump do Trump has a meme he always says the word trumpy always relates back to the word Trump he even talks about it in third person it was not invented by him it was invented by I believe his grandfather or
(10:17) something that used to be named drumpth and they took the name and it had an intrinsic meaning in it so when the word Trump was activated in the other person's brain the notion of being prompted by another person was activated from that point on there was an intense you know almost Century long reinforcement of what the Trump mean meme meme and it's pretty self-rangement referential just like the Elon meme is self-referential it says listen to me I'm the most important person give me all the power because I know and I'm
(10:50) going to make everything better the question is whether there's any accountability in reality to those statements and there's not so how do you get a meme into another person's mind you start by agreeing with them do you notice that I don't do that you notice that I'm not connecting with a lot of people it's because I don't just tell you what you want to hear I don't just give you the sugar otter I give you water and I say please drink a glass of water you need to have a glass of water it's it's not going to be
(11:18) sugary it's not going to be like sold to you it's just water just drink the [ __ ] water everybody else is giving you snake oil it's literally just water and by trying it we establish relationship of trust right because I'm telling you the truth of this water but you don't think it's water because you're a horse for the last time I'm pretty sure what's killing the crops is this brondo stuff the Brando's got what plants crate it's got electrolytes so wait a minute what you're saying is that you want us to put water on the crops
(11:50) yes water like out the toilet well I mean it doesn't have to be out of the toilet but but yeah that's the idea but Brando's got what plants crave it's got electrolytes okay look the plants aren't growing so I'm pretty sure that the Brando's not working now I'm no botanist but I do know that if you put water on Plants they grow oh well I've never seen no plants grow out of no toilet hey that's good you sure you ain't the smartest guy in the world yeah okay look you want to solve this problem I want to get my pardon so why don't we
(12:23) just try it okay and not worry about what plants crave Brando's got what plants crave yeah it's got electrolytes what are electrolytes do you even know it's what they use to make brondo yeah but why did they use them to make brondo because Brothers had insulation you're a horse being led to water you don't know me or maybe you do a little bit the point is like how can you trust me how can you trust me I'm passionate I'm angry I'm weird I don't have power okay how do you trust other people well if they agree with you
(13:06) pausing for a second for you to think about it because you'll notice if you go into many interviews with Trump when he first meets people the first thing he does is he just agrees with them whether or not it actually aligns with their Vision his vision at all or what he wants because he knows they're going to forget it's not about the truth it's not about logic it's about getting the meme planted in the field of your mind it is getting it into the soils because once it's in the soil attention Waters it and then all you have to do is get that
(13:42) attention flowing over that structure and when attention flows over a meme it grows and becomes more connected with the rest of the brain so all you have to do is plant the seed with your finger right into their [ __ ] brain go plant that seed man plant it with your finger and this is something that you do usually through manipulation in this Society usually through advertisement or just through like grift or just kindness uh that is not true you're just like trying to say whatever you can to lower their guard
(14:14) and then once you have that resonance once they're vibing with you once they're in a tensional relationship with you like a [ __ ] orbiting body and like a planet orbiting around a star then that sub-agent that sub being is always going to attend to you it's always going to tune into you and it's going to get its energy to you because this isn't a means it's an abstract thing this is a meme that's a name Elon Trump what has Trump tied to conceptually to these people what is Elon conceptually tied to to you what
(14:48) does he mean to you why do you spend so much physical energy defending the man why do you spend so much thermodynamic energy depending a person who has so much power that you have no influence over who you have no control over or have never met why and so I'm trying to tell you with love and compassion that you were being manipulated and that he knows he's manipulating you and it is Loosely correlated with social good but the second that he added in the pursuit of profit before that and the whole meme set that guides that you noticed that
(15:33) his behavior and outward empathy changed dramatically in fact it dramatically restructured his brain just by allowing into the center of himself the prophet Meme and also by taking unto himself the techniques that Trump used and basically this mentality of the ends justify the means um because in his mind the world is going to crash and the only way to save it is by getting them to Mars lots of people disagree with that lots of people don't agree that is a reasonable future but because he's used my Medics he's
(16:11) gotten all these people with his hooks into them memetic Hooks and therefore they actively ideate and use their own cognition to help him but what I'm saying we should have our cognition be our own we shouldn't always be sold and have our attention stolen from us you should be devoted locally to things that could make our lives better we're so focused on the global that we can't just like look around our neighborhood see what is just functional and take the action we're always looking to Daddy to save us because that's what happens when
(16:44) you have these systems that can concentrate and accrue power into hands just by accumulating that's what you have when you only have an exchange token as your means of mediating power there are all of these advertisement systems and other things like governance to try to check the market but it's it's very clear that the market only partially correlates with social well-being and that it only does that when you have these functional systems regulating it and we're reaching a point with technology where we don't really
(17:16) know how to regulate it anymore and essentially the money meme has mutated and we're getting more and more and more and more into tokenizing memes and just like planting them into brains and saying like this brain this meme will make you rich this meme will solve everything for you this token that you get will AirDrop you this [ __ ] it is all about this parceling into little buckets it's a little tiny things that you can own and sell and there's a very left brain type of thing okay the right brain doesn't think that way and the right
(17:49) rent is actively suppressed the right brain thinks in terms of of holes uh in in terms of all things it is not about dividing it into little Parts but both parts of our conception are important it is important to divide using language to understand things better but then you also have to reunite um I don't have a good metaphor how you do this but literally reuniting is like taking psychedelics or increasing the activation so there's connection between all parts of the brain at the same time you're creating one Activation so you're
(18:26) creating one metamine and then you're like what do I name this meme you're like God it's like Grant what is that like some sort of grand organizing design or some [ __ ] oh so anyways memes are the names that we give to neural cortical structures that activate uh the more that they activate the more intense they feel the more inspired they feel the more important they feel the more of our brains that they cause to fire off the more intensive it feels and so you have two brilliant people and I'm telling Trump really because he used the
(19:00) technique to get so many people and now Elon studied it and he's getting smart people to do the same thing walked on the same path like isn't that crazy we just saw it happen we just saw this happen it was a big problem we saw this happen already and it's happening again I understand why you think Elon is a good person I get it I get it and I truly believe that he started there but I also understand my Medics I just understand where he's uh operating from I also understand the feedbacks like signals that he's getting over time and
(19:32) so I can see where this was laying out and I know that as he gets older and he has not achieved his root meme which is getting to Mars he'll get more and more desperate and he'll be more and more manipulative using uh the power that he is accrued and that's going to be a problem because I don't really personally see anything about landing on Mars as being something that preserves Humanity there's nothing on Mars to extract capitalism only functions when you have an ecosystem that is self-sufficient thermodynamically
(20:03) sufficient that you can extract from it if you over extract from it it dies it becomes a sacrifice Zone and then capitalism can't function in that system Mars is a system like that Mars can't function on capitalism because Mars does not have resources to extract you put people on that planet it just becomes like bound to Earth for its resources so we need to find systems and create systems that can actually you know not just be driven by profit and extraction if we want to expand beyond the boundaries of the Earth
(20:35) Elon doesn't really get this he's operating off of just get there and everything else connects to that how do I get there money power everything else becomes secondary everything that he says is related to that now again that you think that is a person being good but I'm telling you the linkage of the Prophet meme to his incentive is what is can explain every single thing about his behavior from 2018.
(21:03) in 2018 what happened is he was going to lose his power so he was forced to make profit for his companies and his behavior changed because he took the profit meme into the center of his cortical structures and that my friends is mimetics so what is it that Elon is doing that is so agreeable that is making people bind with him without consideration to what the meme actually means well did you notice he started doing a lot of stupid meme stuff online like 69 Dogecoin just kind of resonating with the basic dumb will of the people did you notice
(21:44) that his cognition change the type of memes that seem to flow through his mind and the types of things that he said started to change so there must have been some sort of theory in his mind behind why he was doing that or he's an idiot and is getting infected by memes one of the two depending on who you are and how you see him I see him as an intelligent man so I don't view these uh reflections of memes that are at the heart of the Mind Collective mind space as being innocent they're very very calculated he's just saying I agree
(22:21) with you on something very very basic and once you resonate or once you Vibe then your brain subconsciously allows the meme into your neocortex and it gets encoded as something that is not dangerous not something that you have to fight for and so what happens is that every time that the person attends to the outwards pattern that the meme represents whether it be Trump or whether it be Elon that it is reinforced that by flowing through that structure it actually grows more and it grows more and more and more
(22:59) interconnected we saw this with Trump and then this all connects back to the free energy principle and all the work with active inference and this idea of predictive coding meaning that the brain does not want to expend energy rewiring a bunch of things once the meme once the Elon meme is in there once the Trump meme is in there once it's already guiding the flow of your thoughts and affecting your cognition then your brain views it as part of itself because it is it's literally grown into the structure of your neocortex and to remove it would be
(23:37) to waste a lot of energy so the brain is not really uh consciously allocating energy it's doing so based off of um physics uh in in a lot of different ways and so what we see is over time people refuse to reject the meme no matter how much evidence uh has come up to show them that the meme is actually harming them we saw this over and over and over and over and over and over and over with Trump we're going to see it over and over and over again with Elon because the structure is deeply deeply embedded and connected into the
(24:15) sense of self you know when he's repeating all of these things that are very very basic Into the Heart of the global aggregore like just very simple things like uh dumb memes or resonating with uh you know people in the conservative Community because he has this awareness that the conservative Community does seem to be particularly affected by these techniques it's very all predictable and understandable and all really makes sense about what he is doing so Elon what is Elon doing he's just getting the meme in the mind once the
(24:50) meme is in the mind then he knows in the future he doesn't really need to make a logical argument to people in fact he already has a large collection of people ideating for him thinking for him defending him for him that's the beauty of it is that that's what Trump did is that he got to this point where people started collectively ideating and making excuses for him that were plausible he used the collective brain to make excuses for every bad thing that he did and Elon is just nudging closer and closer and closer in that direction and
(25:25) it's clear that he really wants that type of influence to be able to just get what he wants and not have to explain it to people you know which means that he has some grand plan inside of his mind that he thinks is ultimately true but he doesn't have to share it with anybody it doesn't have to be reviewed by anybody in fact we're all too dumb to know and he gets to manipulate us into being his willful Pawns that's why I push back against this dude I know you have all your theories about the guy you might even aspire to be him
(25:53) and maybe even like the fact that he's using minimetics to manipulate people and you're thinking I'll try that please don't like I'm telling you this is a bad thing I'm telling you that the way that we interrelate as a society is not healthy and I'm coming to you out of a place of honesty uh seeking your trust seeking an engagement between you like you are a person on the other end of the screen you're sitting you have worries hopes dreams and I'm saying hey the world seems kind of scary there's kind of a scary future and I think that I can
(26:27) help you by giving you tools but those tools might kind of show you that you are being manipulated or show you things that hurt at first like when you reveal the rose-covered glasses when you just reveal the haze over your eyes it might hurt at first and when something hurts we try to hide from it and that's what makes it so difficult to acknowledge the very structure and foundation of the problem facing us and again we do not have to get rid of money entirely it is you know it seems to do certain things well but
(27:04) I'm saying that the means by which we sell things which is this advertisement which is this much more complex layer has been so hacked and over optimized that we no longer know how to even listen to each other it's just constant uh mimetic hooks at each other all the time and it what it looks like is it looks like you know an ad page on the Internet it's overwhelming so yeah Elon what he is doing is he starts by basically agreeing via dumb beans he's resonating on memes that are very very simple once he resonates he has the
(27:42) hooks once he has the hooks and the brains the brains do the thinking and defending for him once he does that he can do more and he has from the bottom up power if you if you watch the rules for rules you know that take the throne to act and the throne acts upon you except that or turn back now before we discuss the rules for rulers [Music] if you watch the rules for rules you you know that there is both the power of the people who are directly connected to him and there's power in America which is supposed to come from the Democratic
(28:17) electorate so that's like all of just the the people so the more Minds that you can collect to support you from the bottom through this these manipulative tactics of mimetics you know the more you don't need to deal with the other smart people around you who also have power and money like people find it difficult to fight Elon now like very rich people like they do not have the same level of power and that's why he bought Twitter so that he can influence the conversation so he can control the way people are thinking about the world
(28:50) and there also is in him a part that is doing it for the free speech thing I mean that I mean that I mean that but I don't think that human brains are all completely integrated or unified I don't view him as an integrated brain a view has a person with inconsistencies that he feels like he must hold to be able to achieve his goal so he's not really seeing himself and that's what he's seeing a degradation of his mental health and his physical health in terms of like he's gained weight he just doesn't seem as well
(29:23) um since he's created and forced this new first principle into his mind and tried to change the way that he's relating with the world to ultimately wear the ring to get the most power that he possibly can um to have influence over them the minds of men to be able to enact his vision which is just going to Mars one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness fight Bagel that is the nature of our Consciousness is the idea that there's this one self that rules the body and that self wants to extend as far as it
(30:08) possibly can and wants to hold the whole body and then more capitalism interrelates with the self in the way that it makes the cell phone expand its reaches Beyond its physical matter one ring to find them one ring to bring them all in the darkness fight okay so to answer the question directly how do you get a new meme into another person's brand the answer is simple you copy a fake version of the memes it's not the true thing because it is the name it is the identifier which is the most important thing within the society
(30:49) that we live in The Language Center has taken on so much power in the brain that if you just activate the right words in the right way and get the meme to grow in there it becomes an index in your lookup table then you can build upon that over time and so that's what a lot of these snake oil salesmen are doing is that they're starting by just getting the meme in the mind it's like a named Placebo pill but the the pill is inherently bound to the person uh it's not necessarily bound to the idea and when it's just bound to the
(31:35) idea then we get this sort of religions that continue on uh post life that's when we have gods that become basically you know they're like cells they take on similar characteristics to selves and that they have like images that we imagine them and we imagine them as being corporeal and they seem to exist in the mimetic space beyond our lifespan so essentially you know what you have is Trump and Elon abusing this technique to be able to get um a version of the meme that they know uh is acceptable to the mind because
(32:11) they know that the true version of the meme will not resonate with the mind that's the most important thing is that you are actively not telling the truth so that you can get the meme into the mime mind so that in the future when you tell them the real truth they are more willing to accept it it's all about just drawing attention and binding attention and trust to that symbol now cognizism is about saying that the idea of just binding trust to symbols is broken it won't work bagel no it's not you know you need something more complex
(32:51) like more complex epistemic Tech to be able to make sense of the world at the scale when you have so much information you have so much complexity and you have so many people talking all at the same time so the reason why I don't sugarcoat a lot of things for people or hold your hand or try to be kind and sweet or try to form a company is because I'm always thinking about these theories and I understand Minds across time I think a lot of people think about implementing ideas and they think about themselves as these six beings I do not
(33:23) think that way I think that when you take the journey the journey changes you like the hero's journey of forming a company is what has become the primary life path that interests most people in society take the throne to act and the throne acts upon you and I'm saying that maybe there are other Heroes Journeys For Humanity that we can take that are Beyond just getting a job and living that same job maybe we can have more unique and interesting lives in the society that we are existing in but we have to understand the Medics and we
(33:55) have to understand how to not be manipulated by pneumatics and we have to understand that there are very small number of people who formed this version of a medics that they can use to manipulate you and it works very very well and in 2017 when I discovered it I applied it for three weeks it works it works it works and it made me feel disgusting I felt like I was talking to cognizism about people and they had never listened to me before and suddenly they started listening to me and they're like yeah that makes
(34:25) sense of course yeah yeah and I was like oh my God oh my God like it was this disgusting realization that like most people don't really know how their thoughts are guided at all and it's actually very easy to manipulate people and I just didn't like the feeling of that switch it didn't seem it felt like too intense of a difference between the way that I was interrelating and the effects that I was getting I was like I'm saying the same thing the truth should be what matters not the packaging if the packaging is the only thing that
(34:59) affects your interpretation of the truth we have a problem because that means the only thing that people are attending to is the packaging and not the message we have become a society of peacocking messages where the only thing that matters about it is the color is the excitedness and is not the actual message that is at the core of the thing being um communicated right and so like I stepped away from it it was really really scary and I have never really engaged with that type of influence um in the same way sense because I find
(35:35) it to be extremely dangerous and I much prefer to just be honest with you and always tell you the truth and really draw your attention to when the manipulation is being done and also parody If I ever do it like you'll notice in my recent videos like I'm doing the the like happy music to try to like show you like how much it binds your attention to how that's sort of problematic and when I look at the you know um the stats of the video that part of the video is re-watched more than 100 I mean people went back to watch it
(36:11) because it was so intriguing but I'm not saying anything there okay and so this is what I'm trying to draw your attention to is that we're not really communicating in a way that is exp changing truth we're communicating in a way that is really about the medium it's like almost all of the meaning is in the medium but you know the message actually gets lost and so like we start with a meme and we start to put it into the world and then in the relationship between pushing a meme outwards and the reaction we get from people it changes the meme over
(36:49) time so if you see me being extremely [ __ ] stubborn about wanting to work with people it's because I know these loops and until I can find people who understand these theories then the same patterns are going to play out with them if I work with them it's very clear to me that if if they do not understand these theories exactly what is going to I say is going to happen it's going to happen because over the last five years I keep making all these predictions based off these theories and they keep coming true and
(37:21) so I don't want to hoard that knowledge I love you I love Humanity as a concept and I would like you to be free I think that's a I think that's a pretty nice thing to want for you I'm not trying to hurt you I'm not trying to harm you I'm trying to help you it's like [ __ ] Gandalf do not take me for some conjure out of cheap tricks I am not trying to rob you [Music] trying to help you okay when I try to say take the ring from you like as a metaphor when I try to say maybe there's something wrong with money maybe there's something with this undue
(38:08) amount of power and it makes you react when I try to take the meme the meme of the Ring just being any meme that you believe in that that guides the flow of your behavior I try to take it from you and you react like Bilbo bagel and an envelope over there on the mantelpiece no wait it's here in my pocket isn't it it's an adult yeah after all why not why should I keep it I think you should leave the ring behind is that so hard well no now it comes to it I don't feel like talking with it it's mine I found it it came to me there's no
(39:11) need to get angry what if I'm angry it's your fault mine [Music] oh my precious precious I called that before but not by you this isn't of yours what I do with my own things I think you've had that ring quite long enough you want it for yourself know who you are we just had this happen you reacted like Bilbo and I know you don't feel like you're binding to the ring I know you don't feel like you're holding the ring you're acting as a subsidiary of the ring but it's real man it's real so just [Applause] consider taking off the ring
(40:02) bagel [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] point out to me that I should probably lay out a prediction in this that either many Bots or many angry people will swarm this video without considering the content of it and the meaning that I'm trying to communicate if I put this out into the world if what I'm saying is true I'm essentially calling the eye of Sauron upon me I'm calling the Naz ghoul upon me if this video is swarmed with attention by beings who want to use their energy to support this particular
(41:04) person if everything that I am saying in this video If all these theories are true then they will not consider the logic of the argument it will be reactive will not be proactive cognition it will be reactive to the activations in their brain which they do not understand because they are not consciously architecting the map of their connectome through conscious meditative ideation and reflexive journaling over time they're reacting to the world basically they don't really have a good idea of their perception of reality over time
(41:40) the Elon seems to be having a very public meltdown right now I think it's related to the fact that he's on Adderall he's said publicly that wellbutian was dangerous and that Adderall was safe and that seemed to imply that he was actively on Adderall and considering his behavior since 2018 I think it may be possible that he was having trouble focusing at that time and he sought out medication to be able to bring his companies into profit I do not know whether there will be lots of bots that swarm me for posting this I
(42:15) know that he's attacking a lot of people very very directly he's Banning people on Twitter and I think people are basically implying to me that I should be afraid for trying to speak the truth about what is going on and that's very concerning that if if just publicly speaking the truth about what I see this man to be doing with his actions whether it be consciously or subconsciously it results in all of these individual beings using their own thermodynamic energy to directly attack me uh it kind of directly reinforces the point so I'm
(42:51) hoping that if anybody who is a defender of the man is watching this that you actually watch the whole thing and if you attack me I'm gonna point you to this part of the video and question why you didn't consume the whole thing and question again do you understand why you are doing what you were doing do you truly understand it because I view Elon as smarter than you I really do I think he's a lot smarter than almost everybody on the planet I think he is the best Optimizer I think if you set him upon a goal uh
(43:32) provide him with data and resources to be able to do that he optimizes towards that goal but if the goal is not aligned with social good or if the Taurus of activation in his mind is bound up in profit as well at the very Foundation of his cognition at the very root of his first principles than what you're going to see is Manifest in his behaviors the type of things that we are seeing and so of course we are seeing the Trump thing happen again because it's not that just you change the People by doing the thing
(44:07) by wearing the ring and doing the magic it changes you too over time it changed both Trump and is changing Elon and they are very trapped in this Loop thermodynamic Loop of action and drive and vision and they just cannot stop and they found a way to get others to support them in their capacity to continue blindly down this path I am asking you to you pause consider why you personally would spend so much physical energy thermodynamic energy I'm not looking for you to create explanations for your behavior at a psychological level
(44:54) I'm not asking for that I'm asking you for you to consider your brain as if it is a thermodynamic soup that does not want to expand energy to rewire just think about that for a second thank you
