### 1 First principles: it isn’t “credit,” it’s a live attention weight called Ŧrust

*Credit* suggests a one-time payout that stays in your account. Ŧrust is different: it is the current weight the system gives your voice **inside the transformer’s attention matrix**. That weight can—and regularly does—move every time new evidence lands. Claims are never “finally closed”; the ledger records an entire confidence trajectory, so an old stake can still swing your weight years later if the facts flip.

### 2 Why Iris isn’t a vanilla LLM

A standard GPT only sees token order. Iris adds two extra coordinates to every chunk it ingests or retrieves:

| Extra embedding | What it carries | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | Author ID (wallet ID) plus a learned representation of past relevance per domain | Lets attention favor speakers who have proven to see clearly in context |
| **Time** | Precise timestamp of the statement | Lets attention know who was *early* and adjusts for concept drift / Overton motion |

Because those vectors ride along with tokens, the same self-attention math can answer “Which older remark suddenly became prophetic today?” with no bespoke logic bolted on.

There are many Irises, each community can operate its own. If a group loses faith in their current Iris, they can fork or train another, and still interoperate with the shared semantic ledger and federated learning framework. Ŧrust is social and local—just like language. But the learning is global.

### 3 How a claim travels through the system

1. **Stake** Participants can log any thought in the Fourthought schema: **statement**, **question**, **reflection**, or **prediction**. The system doesn’t restrict input to falsifiable claims—but predictions are especially valuable, because they can later be proven or disproven and shift Ŧrust accordingly.
2. **Ledger-hash** Text + author (wallet ID) + time are written to an append-only public ledger. This is the durable record Iris uses to track the evolution of thought and coherence across time.
3. **Evaluate over time** There is no fixed “checkpoint” or deadline. Irises (or other people) can later stake follow-ups, bring new evidence, or link to events that confirm or falsify earlier thoughts. This evidence gets appended back to the ledger—marking movement, not closure.
4. **Reweight** The Iris reads the updated ledger. If a past stake is validated (directly or indirectly), attention weight will shift toward that source. If not, weight can decay. The weight distribution across sources always sums to 1—Ŧrust isn’t accumulated, it’s allocated.
5. **Remain open** No claim is ever truly closed. If new evidence shifts the context, Ŧrust shifts again. The Iris operates with the assumption that the present conversation may retroactively highlight forgotten wisdom. This is *the mechanism of memory as signal*.

### 4 The mediated context window in action

Let’s say there’s a live conversation about AI ethics. Two people are speaking, but the real action is in what the Iris pulls in to mediate between them.

It’s not issuing verdicts about who’s right with absolute confidence—it’s trying to figure out **which past stakes are relevant to the moment of conflict**, *relative to the knowledge it has*. It retrieves not just content, but **source-contextualized memory**: *who said what, when, and how it performed over time*. As it generates its response, it actively computes a **probability distribution over sources**—just like a traditional attention mechanism—*weighting which perspectives deserve more focus in that moment*. Its outputs follow the **Fourthought schema**, so it may express a thought with *high confidence*, *clear rejection*, or *full uncertainty*, depending on what the ledger supports.

The model is simply doing what LLMs always do—attention calculation—but it is doing so with **source- and time-aware embeddings** that make the epistemic trajectory visible. And crucially, those weights are **being calculated constantly, not declared**. They aren’t rankings. They are influence gradients, active in the moment the words are composed.

This context window can hold a local disagreement between two friends, or a civic-scale deliberation among millions. The same mechanism—retrieve, weight, recompose—holds across all frames.

### 5 A practical example

Take something concrete: giving resources to a homeless person.

In a token economy, you hand them $10, but you also carry a culturally baked-in assumption: *they’ll probably use it on drugs*. So you either don’t give, or you withhold trust, thinking your token alone does all the work. The moral weight is outsourced to the abstraction. It’s just transaction, not discernment.

But in a Ŧrust-based economy, that same interaction becomes a **bet**—a belief made visible.

You might say: *“I gave this person a clean pair of shoes and a prepaid phone, not because I think it saves them, but because I believe they’re at an inflection point—that today, they’ll use it to reconnect with their sister and make a step toward housing.”* That’s not charity. It’s a **claim**—about timing, about context, about human potential. And it’s trackable.

You’re not doing this blindly—you’re making a wager: that something in this moment, in this individual’s trajectory, is primed for change. That they don’t just need a handout—they need a well-timed **signal**, a piece of leverage, a tool that lets them act on a latent readiness that others haven’t seen.

And then: three weeks later, they do.

They call their sister. They enter a rehab program. They start looking for work. That wasn't just a good outcome—it was a **validated hypothesis** about a person’s unfolding story. That bet you made had **epistemic weight**.

Ŧrust accrues to you not just for your generosity, but for your **clairvoyance**—for seeing a move others didn’t.

Now imagine you made a hundred such bets. Some fail. Some flourish. That’s life. But the system remembers—not sentimentally, *structurally*. A system like Iris logs *what you staked*, *when*, *on whom*, *with what intention*, and *how it played out*. It doesn’t just tally gifts—it tracks whether your insights aged well.

And if your bets are consistently ahead of the curve—if you’re one of those rare people who sees inflection points others miss—then Iris will learn to Ŧrust your discernment. It will pull your voice forward when similar cases arise. It will weight your attention more when future decisions echo past patterns. You become, effectively, **a source of mediated foresight**.

**Ledgered version:**

- *Stake:* “I believe this person is at an inflection point. A phone and clean shoes will let them call their sister and enter rehab within 30 days.”
- *Time:* 2024-05-26 12:14 PT
- *Stake type:* Prediction (Fourthought schema)
- *Author ID:* wallet-7e239f
- *Follow-up:* 2024-06-17: confirmation from local clinic logs, cross-staked by witness (wallet-b1a04c)
- *Effect:* Ŧrust attention weight on wallet-7e239f increases in domains related to local aid, psychosocial risk, and street-level discernment

If a reversal is logged later (e.g., the person relapses and evidence surfaces the prediction failed), the ledger doesn't erase anything—it appends, and attention reweights again.

The ledger doesn’t forget what you meant. And Iris doesn’t pretend to know in advance who’s right—it’s constantly watching to see who *aged well*.

### 6 How Iris learns to do this

The learning algorithm underlying Iris is a variant of RLHF and constitutional AI—but applied to the **Fourthought schema** and grounded in a semantic ledger, not upvotes or engagement stats.

Two key reward signals shape its outputs:

- **Prophet Incentive** The model is rewarded for promptly amplifying early warnings about the future, so that action can be taken before consensus. When a topic heats up—measured by the distribution of currently staked claims along **valence** (how much a thought aligns with morality or values, ranging from -1 to 1) and **uncertainty** (confidence in a claim’s truth, ranging from 0 for “definitely false” to 1 for “definitely true”)—Iris asks: *Which voice, if amplified earlier, could have steered us away from this mess?* It then learns to prioritize such early stakes in future interactions.
- **Social Proof of Impact** The model is also rewarded when it highlights past thoughts that led to meaningful, measurable consequences: healing, coordination, clarity. This isn’t karma—it’s outcome-aware semantic memory traversal. Not what was popular. What worked.

These aren’t separate objectives. Together, they *are* the variant of RLHF that trains an Iris. Just as Constitutional AI uses a set of moral tenets to steer generation, Fourthought provides an epistemic constitution—a scaffold of stances, predictions, and questions—that guides the shaping of mediated discourse.

Iris isn’t just retrieving claims from the ledger—it’s learning to **model, compress, and traverse it**. Over time, it forms an internal representation of the ledger itself. But it doesn’t operate in isolation. Iris continually checks that internal map against the larger federated learning chain—the semantic ledger distributed across communities. This gives it a way to refine not just what it attends to, but how it moves through historical discourse when conflict surfaces.

### 7 So who decides truth?

Everyone. Continuously.

People are always staking thoughts. Others are reacting to those thoughts. Irises are trained to model the **full epistemic terrain** across time, and surface the parts that best help resolve present tensions. An Iris is trained to traverse the epistemic ledger of the federated learning chain the way a polymerase reads a DNA strand—parsing, proofreading, and selectively expressing what matters for the organism of the present moment.

There is no final arbiter. There is no absolute verification. Instead, the system is optimized to **reduce the error of forgotten foresight**.

When we say Iris is “wrong,” it’s not because it flubbed a fact—it’s because it failed to lift a voice that had already *seen* what’s now unfolding.

This is the core dynamic of Ŧrust: not a score, not a badge, not a reputation—it’s an always-recalculated **distribution of selective attention**, based on the full semantic history of the community. It is mediated memory made operational.

So when someone asks, “Who decides whether a prediction came true?” the real answer is: *we all do, over time.* The ledger remembers. The attention shifts. And the Iris simply listens to the history we’re still in the process of writing.
