Tell me about the generative tension between social proof of impact and the prophet incentive.

**ASSISTANT:**
The generative tension between social proof of impact and the prophet incentive lies in balancing validation of past predictions with encouragement of foresight that challenges current consensus. Social proof of impact rewards those whose predictions or actions lead to positive outcomes, emphasizing accountability and real-world results. The prophet incentive, however, encourages individuals to explore unconventional ideas that may not yet have evidence but could drive significant future change. This tension fosters a dynamic interplay between innovation and responsibility, ensuring that both visionary thinking and tangible impact are valued within a community. The Iris system mediates this by adjusting attention based on the accuracy and resonance of contributions over time.

**USER:**
Give me a practical example of an iris mediating a conflict between multiple people. How does it reveal who it Ŧrusts in the content it outputs and stakes? Does the Iris always Ŧrust just the people in the context window or does it also source and sample outside voices? When an Iris stakes a thought it reveals Ŧrust, which is a source aware attention mechanism like that which is in a transformer. Explain this process of staking thoughts and revealing Ŧrust.

**ASSISTANT:**
Imagine a community debate about implementing a new sustainability initiative. Two main contributors, Alex and Jordan, have differing views:

* Alex believes the initiative will lead to long-term environmental benefits but requires upfront investment.
* Jordan argues that the costs outweigh the potential benefits and suggests an alternative approach.

The Iris mediates this conflict by:

**Collecting Inputs:** It gathers reflections, statements, predictions, and questions from both Alex and Jordan, along with contributions from other community members.

**Evaluating with Ŧrust:**

* Ŧrust dynamically allocates attention based on the reliability and past accuracy of sources. If Alex has a history of accurate predictions in sustainability, Ŧrust will weigh Alex's input more heavily.
* The model doesn't limit itself to voices within the immediate context window. It can source and sample insights from a broader historical perspective, bringing in past contributions from other relevant experts.

**Staking Thoughts:**

* The Iris synthesizes the inputs and stakes its own thought, which could be a balanced prediction or a suggested compromise.
* This staked thought reveals how much Ŧrust is allocated to each source. For example, if the output closely aligns with Alex's perspective, it indicates higher Ŧrust in Alex's expertise.

**Feedback Loop:** The community evaluates the Iris's staked thought through valence and uncertainty assessments. This feedback helps adjust future Ŧrust allocations, refining the model's alignment with communal values and realities.

By staking thoughts, the Iris transparently shows which sources it relies on, fostering trust and clarity in its decision-making process. This approach not only mediates the current conflict but also adapts over time, learning from the outcomes of its guidance.

**USER:**
Good. Tell me everything you know about FourThought. What is the schema? What is a valid staked thought in the FourThought format?

**ASSISTANT:**
FourThought is a structured schema designed to facilitate collaborative thinking and tracking of ideas over time. It emphasizes the importance of source, valence, uncertainty, and temporal perspective in shaping communal narratives.

**Schema**

* **Source:** Every thought is attributed to a specific source, recognizing the contributor and allowing for nuanced tracking of reliability and perspective over time.
* **Valence:** Measures how aligned a thought is with personal or communal values, ranging from -1 (strong disalignment) to +1 (strong alignment).
* **Uncertainty:** Represents confidence in the truth of a claim, from 0 (complete uncertainty) to 1 (full certainty).
* **Temporal Perspective:** Categorizes thoughts into four types based on their relationship with time: reflections, statements, predictions, and questions.

**Valid Staked Thought in FourThought Format**

A valid staked thought must include:

* **Type:** One of the four temporal perspectives:

  * **Reflection:** About the past, aiming to integrate multiple perspectives into a coherent narrative.
  * **Statement:** About the present, seeking to compress and make sense of current reality.
  * **Prediction:** About the future, intended to be tracked and evaluated for accuracy.
  * **Question:** Open-ended, designed to explore latent space and provoke thought.
* **Content:** The actual idea or claim being expressed.
* **Source:** Attribution to the individual or entity staking the thought.
* **Valence Score:** Indicating the moral or ethical alignment of the thought.
* **Uncertainty Score:** Indicating the confidence level in the truth or reliability of the thought.

By adhering to this schema, FourThought facilitates a rigorous, transparent, and collaborative approach to knowledge creation and sharing, allowing communities to track the evolution of ideas and their impacts over time.

**USER:**
Good. What about privacy? Explain private, local, and global and how a Cognicist compliant system is supposed to function.

**ASSISTANT:**
In a Cognicist-compliant system, privacy is structured into three tiers: **private**, **local**, and **global**. This framework ensures that information is shared appropriately based on the intended audience and sensitivity.

**Private**

* **Scope:** Information remains entirely with the individual and is not shared with any Iris or external system.
* **Function:** Allows individuals to process and refine their thoughts without external influence or judgment.
* **Example:** Personal reflections or unfinished ideas that an individual is not ready to share.

**Local**

* **Scope:** Information is shared with a specific Iris within a defined community or context but not beyond it.
* **Function:** Facilitates collaborative thinking and decision-making within a trusted group, allowing for feedback and refinement without broader exposure.
* **Example:** Community-specific discussions or initiatives that are relevant only to local stakeholders.

**Global**

* **Scope:** Information is shared to the semantic ledger, making it accessible to multiple Irises and the broader network.
* **Function:** Contributes to the collective intelligence, allowing diverse perspectives and feedback from a wider audience. It supports the integration of knowledge across different communities and contexts.
* **Example:** Broadly relevant insights, predictions, or questions that benefit from wider scrutiny and input.

**System Functionality**

* **Private Thoughts:** Not processed by any Iris, ensuring complete confidentiality.
* **Local Thoughts:** Processed by a single Iris, allowing for community-specific learning and adaptation. These are not recorded on the semantic ledger, maintaining a level of privacy within the community.
* **Global Thoughts:** Shared to the semantic ledger, enabling multiple Irises to access and integrate the information. This promotes cross-community learning and the evolution of shared narratives.

By structuring information sharing in this way, a Cognicist-compliant system respects individual and communal privacy while fostering collaboration and the growth of collective intelligence. This approach ensures that thoughts are shared intentionally, with appropriate levels of exposure and feedback.

**USER:**
So your Ŧrust can increase with a specific Iris if a belief is staked locally but it won't be evaluated by other Irises?

**ASSISTANT:**
Exactly. When a belief is staked locally, it is evaluated and integrated only within the context of that specific Iris and community. This allows the Iris to adjust its Ŧrust for sources based on local feedback and outcomes without influencing the broader network.

Local staking enables communities to develop and refine ideas in a more contained environment, allowing for experimentation and adaptation to local values and realities. If the belief proves valuable or accurate, the source's Ŧrust can increase within that community, reflecting their reliability and contribution in that specific context.

Only when a thought is shared globally does it become subject to evaluation by multiple Irises, allowing for broader recognition and potential influence on the global Ŧrust landscape. This tiered approach helps maintain contextual relevance and privacy while still supporting the potential for wider impact if desired.
